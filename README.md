## Executive Summary
This risk report provides a detailed analysis of the key risks associated with Barclays Bank, offering critical insights for an investor with £100,000 considering an investment. The report examines various risk categories, including market, liquidity, sector, reputational, operational, credit, country, and legal/compliance risks, and their potential impact on the investment. Key findings include:

**Market Risks:** Barclays Bank faces significant risks related to interest rates, exchange rates, and market volatility. These risks could result in an investor losing between £15,000 to £25,000 within a month.

**Liquidity Risks:** Structural, prepayment, and recruitment risks are prominent. An investor could face a potential loss of £163 in a month due to liquidity issues.

**Sector Risks:** The rapid growth of FinTech and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit are major sectoral risks.

**Reputational Risks:** Failure to comply with regulations, government policies, and technical system failures pose significant threats to Barclays' reputation.

**Operational Risks:** Cyber threats, fraud, processing errors, and technology changes are key operational risks. Barclays has reserved £56,660 million in capital under Basel II standards to mitigate these risks.

**Credit Risks:** These include impairment, borrower defaults, and credit quality deterioration. Barclays currently holds an ‘A’ credit rating from Moody’s, with a 99.17% probability of maintaining this rating over the next month.

**Country Risks:** Political and economic instability, government debt burdens, and regulatory risks are concerns. Sovereign ratings for the U.S., UK, and India are Aa2, Aaa, and Baa2, respectively.

**Legal and Compliance Risks:** Risks include issues related to contractual arrangements, litigation, and regulatory compliance.
The investor should carefully consider these risks before making an investment decision.

Barclays Mission Statement
“Our common Purpose is ‘Creating opportunities to rise.’ We are a company of opportunity makers working together to help people rise—customers, clients, colleagues, and society” (Barclays, 2019).

In recent years, Barclays has introduced initiatives like the Digital Eagle program to protect customers from fraud and has supported young individuals with workshops aimed at preparing them for the workforce.

**Overview of the Role of Risk Management in Organizations**

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) at Barclays is a comprehensive process designed to ensure effective risk management across the organization. The ERM approach involves:

Risk Identification and Assessment: Conducting risk control self-assessments to identify, evaluate, and mitigate risks.

Risk Mitigation and Monitoring: Implementing controls, monitoring risks, and reporting them transparently.

Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC): Ensuring a solid GRC structure to address uncertainties, achieve goals, and maintain integrity.

Risk Appetite Framework: Defining the level of risk the company is willing to tolerate.

Risk Decomposition and Aggregation: Decomposing risks to ensure full coverage and aggregating them to reduce systematic risk through diversification.

Effective risk management is critical to Barclays' ability to achieve its goals and ensure long-term sustainability.

**Role of RAROC in the Banking Sector**
Risk-Adjusted Return on Capital (RAROC) is a key metric in financial risk management, used to allocate capital across different business units within the bank. RAROC helps determine the optimal capital structure by correlating economic capital with the risk profile of each unit.

RAROC is calculated as:

RAROC
=
Revenue
−
(
Costs
+
Expected Losses
+
Taxes
)
Economic Capital
RAROC= 
Economic Capital
Revenue−(Costs+Expected Losses+Taxes)
​
 
This metric enables analysts to compare Barclays' financial performance with that of other financial institutions, such as ING Bank, Lloyds, and Credit Suisse, by evaluating their respective RAROC values.

This financial risk management & reporting project provides an overview of the key components of the Barclays Bank Risk Report Group Project, detailing the risk measurement methodologies used (VaR analysis, stress testing, and scenario analysis), literarure research, and summarizing the critical findings and their implications for potential investors.
